# Why do you want to work for XYZ (Amazon as an example)?

Thera are at least three points of why, as I see it:

1. Customer-centric

I discovered [14 Amazon Leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles) a while ago while working on the training program for our Engineering Leadership.
What I relly liked is Customer Obsession and it is really resonating to me. I believe, there's a big difference between providing a service and being willing to serve.
So, I'm always looking for the ways to put my own customer service skills to the good use. I can do this by working for Amazon and owning this honorablee responsibility of delivering valuable results.

2. People around me

From what I understand, Amazon employs the most forward thinking and intelligent people awailable. It is extremely valuable to me to be a part of a great team and constantly challenge myself to learn and grow. I believe I can commit to this culture by helping other people to evolve by shring my knowledge and experience.

3. Pushing the limits as a lifestyle

Based on what I know, Amazon is a company that continually raises the bar of innovation and breaks into new markets. I'd be very excited being a part of this culture of always looking forward towards the best service to its customers. I want to commit to this kind of culture.

# Do you like to remain technical and why?

I think being technical is awesome because I can deliver the value fast and at the same time having near to immediate feedback loop from your customers.

Another great thing is I can use data driven approach to act in an ambiguous environment. If I  think I've invented something useful to people, I can validate my idea by presenting it to the real customers within days, sometimes even hours.

Same is fare for fixes and optimizations of existing things. Technology gives me the fastest feedback loop ever.

Craftsmanship is another important piece of my tech world. I like great tools and the fact you can invent new and better ones or shrpeen existing for your needs and by yourself.

VS Code as my main text editor nowadays is one great example, Docker is another. By combining those two together, I can spin up my own uique environment in a matter of fminutes and thhen store its definition to git to make it awailable everuwhere.

Another example is AWS SDK, written in JS and open-sourced. I can learn out of its code doing my regular daily troubleshooting.
